In our Year 2 Game Engine Architecture module we had to implement some mechanics from Remedy's Control in two game engines. 

This is the Unreal version of that project and was my first time using the engine!

Controls:
   - Move: WSAD
   - Jump: Space
   - Launch: E 
   - Shield: Q 
   - Levitate: V 
      - Levitate Up: Space
      - Levitate Down: Left Control
